# core-programming-logic

A curated collection of foundational programming problems with full algorithmic explanations and reusable helper functions, solved using JavaScript.

## Project Structure

/easy/ → Easy-level problems
/medium/ → Medium-level problems
/hard/ → Hard-level problems
/data-structures-basics/ → Classic DSA problems
/logic-notes/ → Markdown explanations of problem logic


Each problem has:
- A `.js` file for the solution
- A `.md` file for step-by-step logic explanation

---

## Purpose

- Practice clean and optimized code
- Explain the logic behind solutions for long-term retention
- Build a strong base for DSA and problem-solving interviews
- Keep this as a personal logic library and teaching tool

# TL;DR

- As of July 9, 2025, project's still in progress, I'm actively grinding (17-18 commits today), y'all gotta be patient for this elixir, once you truly get it, every programming language will feel like child's play.
