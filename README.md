### Why This Project?

Tired of learning syntax for every new language? This project is built on the core belief that **fundamental programming logic transcends language boundaries.** By mastering the concepts here in JavaScript, you'll gain a universal understanding that makes coding effectively in *any* language intuitive and accessible.

This repository aims to:
* **Practice clean and optimized code:** See real-world applications of best practices.
* **Explain the logic behind solutions for long-term retention:** Don't just copy-paste; truly understand *why* and *how* algorithms work through detailed explanations.
* **Build a strong base for Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and technical interviews:** Sharpen your problem-solving skills crucial for career growth.
* **Serve as a personal logic library and teaching tool:** A go-to resource for revisiting core concepts or explaining them to others.

### Project Overview

This repository is structured to guide you through programming challenges categorized by difficulty, with a unique emphasis on the underlying logic.

* `/easy/` → Fundamental problems to build confidence.
* `/medium/` → Intermediate challenges to deepen your understanding.
* `/hard/` → Advanced problems to push your problem-solving limits.
* `/data-structures-basics/` → Essential implementations of classic data structures.
* `/logic-notes/` → **Your key to mastery!** This folder mirrors the problem structure and contains detailed Markdown (`.md`) files explaining the step-by-step logic and multiple approaches for each problem.

**Inside, you'll find:**
* A `.js` file containing 5-6 different solutions to the problem, showcasing various logical approaches or optimizations.
* A corresponding `.md` file in the `logic-notes` directory, providing an in-depth, conceptual breakdown of the problem's solution.

### Getting Started

Ready to dive in? Follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/0xrootAnon/core-programming-logic
    ```

2.  **Explore a problem:** Navigate to any difficulty folder (e.g., `/easy/`) and select a problem file (e.g., `exampleProblem.js`).
3.  **Understand the Logic (Recommended First!):** Crucially, open the corresponding Markdown file in `/logic-notes/` (e.g., `/logic-notes/easy/numbers/exampleProblem.md`) to read the detailed algorithmic explanation.
4.  **Analyze the Solutions:** Review the `.js` file to see how the explained logic is implemented through multiple different code solutions.
5.  **Practice & Apply:** Try solving the problem yourself, then compare your solution, or even try implementing the logic in another programming language!
